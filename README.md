# ![RealWorld Example App](logo.png)

> **React / Vite + SWC / Express.js / Sequelize / PostgreSQL codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://realworld.io/) spec and API.**

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **React / Vite + SWC / Express.js / Sequelize / PostgreSQL** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

**[Demo app](https://conduit-realworld-example-app.fly.dev/)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;[With Create React App](https://github.com/TonyMckes/conduit-realworld-example-app/tree/create-react-app)&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;[Other RealWorld Example Apps](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=fullstack)**

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you install and run the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

Before you run the project, make sure that you have the following tools and software installed on your computer:

- Text editor/IDE (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) `v22.12.0+`
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually included with Node.js)
- SQL database

### Installation

To install the project on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TonyMckes/conduit-realworld-example-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd conduit-realworld-example-app
   ```

3. Install project dependencies by running the command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Copy [`backend/.env.example`](backend/.env.example) to `backend/.env`.
2. Set your PostgreSQL credentials and choose **different database names** for development and tests. The backend and migration CLI read `backend/.env`.
3. (Optional) update the Sequelize configuration parameters in the [`config.js`](backend/config/config.js) file
4. If you are **not** using PostgreSQL, you may also have to install the driver for your database:

   <details>
   <summary>Use one of the following commands to install:</summary><br/>

   > Note: `-w backend` option is used to install it in the backend [`package.json`](backend/package.json).

   ```bash
   npm install -w backend pg pg-hstore  # Postgres (already installed)
   npm install -w backend mysql2
   npm install -w backend mariadb
   npm install -w backend sqlite3
   npm install -w backend tedious       # Microsoft SQL Server
   npm install -w backend oracledb      # Oracle Database
   ```

   > :information_source: Visit [Sequelize - Installing](https://sequelize.org/docs/v6/getting-started/#installing) for more infomation.

   ***

   </details>

5. Create database specified by configuration by executing

   > :warning: Please, make sure you have already created a superuser for your database.

   ```bash
   npm run sqlz -- db:create
   ```

   > :information_source: The command `npm run sqlz` is an alias for `npx -w backend sequelize-cli`.  
   > Execute `npm run sqlz -- --help` to see more of `sequelize-cli` commands availables.

6. Apply migrations before seeding or starting the app:

   ```bash
   npm run sqlz -- db:migrate
   ```

7. Optionally you can run the following command to populate your database with some dummy data:

   ```bash
   npm run sqlz -- db:seed:all
   ```

### Usage

#### Development Server

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server by executing the command:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to:
   - Home page should be available at [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000).
   - API endpoints should be available at [`http://localhost:3001/api`](http://localhost:3001/api).

#### Running Tests

Run the unit and API tests after creating and migrating the separate test database:

```bash
npm run sqlz -- db:create --env test
npm run sqlz -- db:migrate --env test
npm test -- --run
```

`db:create` is needed once per new local database. The test suite guards against using the development database as the test database.

For the browser E2E flow, install Chromium once and run:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

Playwright starts the backend with `NODE_ENV=test` and the Vite frontend on isolated ports 3101 and 3100. Your usual development servers on 3001 and 3000 can keep running. The browser test signs up with a unique test account, logs out and back in, creates its own article, and exercises the Collections UI. Run it only against your dedicated test database; test accounts and articles remain there for inspection. On Linux, Chromium may require `npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`.

GitHub Actions runs `npm ci`, applies migrations to a fresh PostgreSQL service, runs unit/API tests and the frontend build, then runs the Chromium E2E test. Browser failure screenshots and traces are uploaded as workflow artifacts.

#### Production

The following command will build the production version of the app:

```bash
npm run start
```
